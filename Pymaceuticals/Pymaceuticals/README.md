# Pymaceuticals
Mathplotlib Challenge

## For this project we were assigned the task of sorting through a study focusing on anti-cancer medications. In order to find the most accurate data we first must identify any duplicate or missing samples th provide true findings.

    Utilizing a variety of programs, including Python, Pandas and Matplotlib, we were able to display our findings via bar, pie and scatter plots.
    
    While no concrete findings can be determined, some conclusions can be inferred.
        * Capomulin and Ramicone appear to produce the greatest overall success rate in terms of Final Tumor Volume. In particular, Capomulin displayed an overall reduction in Tumor size over the timeframe of the study.
        * While there was on test subject on the Infubinol regimen, it appears that it was the worst performing treatment.
        
        * A direct correlation between the weight of the subject in relation to the size of the tumor can be asserted.
        
    Further research is needed with perhaps a sample size greater than the length of this study.
